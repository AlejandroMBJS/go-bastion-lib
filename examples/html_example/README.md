# HTML Example

This example demonstrates how to use server-side HTML rendering with the `go-bastion-lib` framework.

## Running the example

1.  Navigate to the example directory:
    ```bash
    cd examples/html_example
    ```
2.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    go run .
    ```
3.  Open your browser or use `curl` to access:
